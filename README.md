# Hallucination-Detection

This project came out of my work in CS 329X at Stanford University on a team with Spencer Louis Paul and Ethan Hellman. The results, architecture, and more elements of the project are highlighted in the repository's report. However, due to Stanford policy, the code cannot be shared publicly. Despite this, the report can be shared to highlight the intricacies of the project.
